# KiCad to Fritzing
A utility to generate a Fritzing part from KiCad board

## Overview
The idea is to convert the SVG generated by KiCad PCB New into a Fritzin part. This begs the question, "Why?". I found when creating documentation about the boards I have made and worked on it Fritzing provides a nice way to show the connections of the boards. I found it als quite tedious to manually do the conversion. The hope is here to provide a utility that will do the hard work.
It is not intended to be a photographic-true representation but rather a basic outline and the main connection points. Perhaps improvements and refinements may be possible when more is understood about working with the KiCad SDK.
